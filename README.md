# Custom Array List 

This project is a custom implementation of the ArrayList data structure in Java. It was created as an assignment to deepen understanding of algorithms and data structures by implementing them from scratch.

## Key Features 
- Custom Implementation of ArrayList: Provides a comprehensive understanding of how an ArrayList works internally by building it from the ground up.
- CustomArrayList Class: Implements the CustomList interface and provides functionality for adding, removing, and accessing elements.
- Automatic Resizing: The CustomArrayList dynamically resizes itself when the number of elements exceeds its current capacity.
- CustomArrayListTest Class: Contains a main method to test the CustomArrayList functionality.
